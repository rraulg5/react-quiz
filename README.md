# React Quiz App

A demo of this app can be found [here](TBD).

The intention of this project was to practice and learn about React and Typescript, it was created following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2JCjVSZlG0).

I also did (from my pov) some improvements like:

- Update the colors (in order to match better with the image I chose)
- Move all the logic to a custom hook called useQuiz()

## Technologies / Resources used in this project

- React
- Typescript
- [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/)
- Font: Rubik

## To Do

- Implement the extra options on the API (category, difficultity) as inputs to modify the question, at the moment they're hardcoded
- Create Unit tests
